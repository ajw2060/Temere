# Temere
A Scheduling tool with built in randomisation to control smart devices.

Temere allows a schedule to be built to switch on and switch off smart devices such as lights and sockets.  The schedule is seeded with controlled randomisation so the devices do not operate at exactly the same time every day.

The following files are included here.
- backup of the MySQL table structure
- PHP files for the web interface
- The python scripts used for data management
- Sample python scripts for device control

The credentials in the YAML files need to be updated to suit your environment.
